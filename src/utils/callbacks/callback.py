    Abstract base class to build callbacks.
    Inspired by keras' callbacks.
    A callback is a set of functions to be applied at given stages
    of the training procedure. You can use callbacks to get a view
    on internal states and statistics of the model during training.
    You can pass a list of callbacks (as the keyword argument callbacks)
    to the train() method of the SupervisedTrainer.
    The relevant methods of the callbacks will then be called at each
    stage of the training.
